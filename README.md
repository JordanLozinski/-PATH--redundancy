#PATH REDUNDANCY REMOVER

Uses Python 3.4

The PATH system variable in Windows has a max length depending on which operating system one is using. I learned I had accidentally duplicated lots of the entries to it in messing with it, so I wrote this to remove redundant entries in the PATH variable.
